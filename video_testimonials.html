                    <h2>Mr. Sachin</h2>

                    <p>“Last Thursday while doing a speed run I had a hamstring pull”

                        We at Kinspire take such things as a challenge. People train all year round and sometimes due to
                        some incidents the possibilities of them successfully completing the Marathon are almost zero.
                        When a runner like Mr. Sachin with such a genuine passion comes to us for recovery, we put in
                        all our efforts to make sure he runs the race successfully. For most of these people it’s not
                        about being their personal best or winning these races. It’s just about being a part of the
                        event which they have dreamt of and waited all year long. Mr. Sachin is an avid marathon runner
                        who has been a marathon runner for many years and was one of the first runners to reach at the
                        recovery zone.</p>

                    <h2>Ms. Moushmi Thakur</h2>

                    <p>“This was one of my best runs ever”
                        Being a part of the journey of runners like Moushmi who have a passion to not just reach the
                        finish line but achieve their personal best is an overwhelming experience. Moushmi Thakur has
                        been running for the last 7 years and her journey is one of the most inspiring where any injury
                        or any setback has never stopped her from achieving her goal. We are proud to be a part of her
                        success in the Tata Mumbai Marathon.</p>

                    <p>“Kinspire’s satisfaction is when runners do well”

                        Sometimes our patients put it out better than us. Thank you for you kind words Mr. Navin
